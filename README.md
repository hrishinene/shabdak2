# shabdak2
Devnagari Script oriented shabdak with a game and classes to analyse the words

Here is the procedure to build and run multi-attempt, multi-alphabet - kana/matra/velanti/ukar/anuswar/ etc. words
1. Pull the source
2. cd .../shabdak2
3. mkdir bin
4. javac src/shabdak2/*.java -d ./bin
5. cd bin
6. java shabdak2.Khel 

Just like Khel, there are other classes with Main() function which can be used to process/prune word lists and more Unicode experiments
